3. **Protection Against Proxies**: Measures should be taken to ensure that proxies for demographic features do not lead to discrimination.

4. **Accessibility**: Systems should be designed to be accessible to people with disabilities.

5. **Disparity Testing and Mitigation**: Ongoing testing for disparities should be conducted both before deployment and continuously after, with measures taken to address any identified issues.

6. **Organizational Oversight**: There should be clear oversight within organizations to ensure compliance with these protections.

7. **Independent Evaluation**: An independent evaluation of the systems should be performed, including algorithmic impact assessments that report on disparity testing results and mitigation efforts, which should be made public whenever possible.

These rights aim to protect individuals and communities from algorithmic discrimination and ensure that automated systems are used and designed equitably."
What rights do I have to ensure that my data stays private?,"You have rights to ensure that your data stays private, including:

1. **Agency Over Data Use**: You should have control over how data about you is used, including the ability to give or withdraw consent for data collection and use.

2. **Built-in Protections**: Systems should include default protections against abusive data practices, ensuring that only data strictly necessary for a specific context is collected.

3. **Transparency and Clarity**: Designers and developers should seek your permission and respect your decisions regarding the collection, use, access, transfer, and deletion of your data.

4. **Privacy by Design**: Systems should be designed to avoid obfuscating user choices and should not burden users with defaults that are invasive to privacy.

5. **Ethical Oversight**: There should be ethical reviews and prohibitions on the use of data and related inferences, protecting you from unchecked surveillance.

6. **Access to Reporting**: You should have access to reports that confirm your data decisions have been respected and assess the impact of surveillance technologies on your rights and opportunities.

These rights aim to protect you from violations of privacy and ensure that your data is handled responsibly."
What rights do I have to ensure safe and effective systems?,"You have the right to be protected from unsafe or ineffective systems. Automated systems should be developed with input from diverse communities, stakeholders, and domain experts to identify concerns and risks. These systems must undergo pre-deployment testing, risk identification, and ongoing monitoring to ensure they are safe and effective for their intended use. You also have the right to not have a system deployed if it poses a risk to your safety or the safety of your community. Additionally, automated systems should be designed to proactively protect you from potential harms."
What rights do I have to ensure that I am given adequate explanation and notice re the use of AI systems?,"You have the right to be informed when an automated system is being used and to understand how and why it contributes to outcomes that impact you. Designers, developers, and deployers of these systems are required to provide accessible documentation that includes:

1. Clear descriptions of the overall system functioning and the role of automation.
2. Notice that such systems are in use.
3. Information about the individual or organization responsible for the system.
4. Explanations of outcomes that are clear, timely, and accessible.

Additionally, you should be notified of significant changes in use cases or key functionalities. You have the right to know how and why an outcome affecting you was determined by the automated system, including when it is not the sole input determining the outcome. The explanations provided should be technically valid, meaningful, and useful to you and others who need to understand the system."
What rights do I have to ensure recourse to alternatives and remedy problems that I encounter?,I don't know.
How can organizations put data privacy into practice?,"Organizations can put data privacy into practice by proactively identifying potential harms and managing them to avoid, mitigate, and respond appropriately to identified risks. This includes determining not to process data when privacy risks outweigh the benefits and implementing measures to mitigate acceptable risks. Organizations should also follow privacy-preserving security best practices, such as using privacy-enhancing technologies and fine-grained permissions and access control mechanisms to ensure that data does not leak beyond the specific consented use case. Additionally, consent for data collection should be meaningful, understandable, and provided in plain language, ensuring that users have agency over their data. Enhanced protections should be in place for sensitive domains, and organizations should avoid design choices that obscure user choice or impose privacy-invasive defaults."
How can organizations put into practice protection against algorithmic discrimination,"Organizations can put into practice protection against algorithmic discrimination by implementing several key strategies:

1. **Monitoring and Assessment**: Regularly assess automated systems to determine if they have led to algorithmic discrimination. This should be done frequently, especially for riskier and higher-impact systems, and whenever unusual patterns in results are observed.

2. **Use of Proxy Features**: Ensure that any proxy features used in the algorithms are not given undue weight. Organizations should also explore alternative attributes that can be used instead of potentially discriminatory ones.

3. **Demographic Analysis**: Conduct assessments that take into account demographic information of impacted individuals. This can involve testing with a sample of users or conducting qualitative user experience research to understand the impact of the automated systems.

4. **Disparity Mitigation**: If assessments reveal disparities, organizations should implement additional measures to mitigate these disparities. If equity standards are not being met and cannot be improved, reverting to earlier procedures that adhered better to equity standards may be necessary.

5. **Guidance and Principles**: Follow established principles and guidelines that help incorporate protections against algorithmic discrimination into policy and practice, ensuring that these considerations are integrated into the technological design process.

By following these steps, organizations can better protect against algorithmic discrimination and promote equity in their automated systems."
